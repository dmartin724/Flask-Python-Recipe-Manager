# Flask Cooking Recipes-Book
This project/repositary contains the code for a platform/application to store Cooking recipes. Users will be able to add, modify, delete recipes, categorise them and do basic searches.
This application has mainly been built using technologies as Python and the Flask framework.

## UX
This platform hass been built to be fully responsive so it works perfectly on any device screen size.

Initial Wireframes can be found below:

## Challenges
- Flask and MongoDB integration was a great learning experience but tricky at times. 
- Creating the logic and routes on python has been the biggest challenge for me.


## Technologies Used

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [MaterilizeCss](https://materializecss.com) - Materilize has been used as the primary HTML/CSS framework.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript) - to activate Materilize elements and for DOM manipulation.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Python framework used to build the platform. 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Relational database store for model data.
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - Interface to manage MongoDB manually.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Platform used to import the entirely platfom into the cloud.


## Production Deployment

See a live version of this platform [here](https://recipes-manager-flask.herokuapp.com/).

##### The process I took was as follows:

- Create Heroku repositery.
- Login to Heroku: heroku login
- Open your project, create a local git repository: git init
- Add Heroku as remote: git remote add origin https://recipes-manager-flask.herokuapp.com/
- Add changes: git add .
- Commit changes: $ git commit -am "make it better"
- Push changes: git push heroku master


## Databse schema:

There two types of collection within MongoDB. one is the actual recipes and then the cuisines types called categories. See below an example of how they are both structured:

- The main MongoDB collection `recipes` takes he following schema.

```json
{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "5ca5f9c11c9d440000fcef84"
    },
    "recipe_name": "Pizza Margarita",
    "category_name": "Italian",
    "recipe_intro": "This is a classic pizza",
    "description": "Mix all ingredients. Bake for 35 mins at 180C",
    "ingredients": "Cheese, flower, eggs, tomato sauce, oil, ham",
    "prep-time": "19 min",
  }
```
- The second MongoDB collection `categories` takes he following schema.

```json
{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "5ca5f9c11c9d440000fcef54"
    },
    "category_name": "Italian",
  }
```
